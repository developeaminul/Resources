Image Usage Guideline

Tool:

Use a premium tool for taking screenshots, ideally Droplr. You can also use Lightshot, ShareX, etc.  

Zoom-in:

Zoom in to focus on the subject before taking a screenshot. 

Image Dimensions:

Make sure the image width and height (W X H) px is: 919 x 500. You can change the height (+/-) if required. But NEVER change (+/-) the width. 

Shape:

Do not make any screenshot round manually. Take and use a screenshot from a square or by default angle. 


Theme:

Use either the Hello Elementor or Astra theme on your localhost website. Please be careful about the background. Keep it white or clean in color.

Indications/Annotations:

Make sure that the marked portion in the image is pointed with arrows and explained with clearly readable texts. 

Compression:

Compress all the images before uploading them to the website. Use https://tinypng.com or https://compresspng.com site for compressing images. If it is a gif image, you can use https://gifcompressor.com/ 

Naming:

Give the screenshots names following the guidelines below: 

Be specific and precise (so that anyone can understand)
Use lowercase
Never use a numeric number
Name the image before uploading it to your PC
Use underscore (_) for naming

Remove Duplicates:

Always remove the duplicate screenshots/images when you replace them. 


Use Alt Tag:

Always use alt tags for all the uploaded images. 
Use the focus keyword as the alt attribute

Avoid Copyrighted Images:

Do not use any copyrighted images in any blog/documentation. 
You can use copyright-free images from Google and Image Sharing websites (Pixabay, Pexels, etc.) 
In case you don’t get the image you need from any other sources, get your required image designed by the designer. 


Featured Image :

Assign and give a brief to a designer for making featured images for the blogs.
